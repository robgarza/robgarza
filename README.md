- 👋 Hi, I’m @robgarza
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience in PHP and SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to PHP, Python, or SQL
- 📫 How to reach me ... Invite only, sorry!

I've spent the last year or so adding PHP, SQL, and WordPress to my repertoire and now I am learning Python as part of [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum) Computer Science curriculum.

I'll be posting some thing's I've worked on as part of certificate courses or real world projects soon! I'll leave you with an idea of what's coming
-CMS coded in PHP and SQL as part of a PHP course on Udemy.
-WordPress plugin for using input from webforms to create PDFs using the FPDF library
-Gym website as part of a WordPress website and plugin development course.
-And more!
