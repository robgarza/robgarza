- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to PHP, Python, or SQL
- 📫 How to reach me ... Invite only, sorry!

I've spent the last year or so adding PHP, SQL, and WordPress to my repertoire and now I am learning Python as part of [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum) Computer Science curriculum.

I've recently posted some personal projects. Here are some links!

I was asked to code up a mock library site. I made two versions, one with Bootstrap 4 and one with HTML and CSS only. I'll be refactoring the Bootstrap 4 version to version 5 soon.

Bootstrap Version:

Non-Bootstrap Version
Repository: https://github.com/robgarza/library-site-mock-up-no-bootstrap/tree/master
GitHub Page: https://robgarza.github.io/library-site-mock-up-no-bootstrap/

I recently saw someone make a database with user forms, entry navigation, table previews, and printing. They used MS Access and I decided to code it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL.
